# TTPasteHistory
**TTPasteHistory** is a `plugin` for Xcode. **Recording you copy-and-paste history easily to write the code**.

When you type in Xcode, it's sure you use `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` to program. When you copy the text, e.g.**LineOne**. You paste **LineOne**. Then you copy the text, e.g.**LineTwo**, you paste **LineTwo**. After a while, you want to paste the **LineOne** again. You should copy again.

The **TTPasteHistory** plugin can help you decrease your copy count.

**TTPasteHistory** will record the last 10 copy-and-paste strings. You just type **`Cmd + Shift + V`**, the copy-and-paste history contents will show in your Xcode edit area, although you exit the Xcode.

## Usage
You can use [Alcatraz](https://github.com/alcatraz/Alcatraz), search `TTPasteHistory`.
Or you can download the project, and build it. Then restart your Xcode. You can use the feature.

## Note
If you have any bug with it, please contact me with `tufei.fly # gmail.com`(replace the `#` with `@`) or create a issue. 

After that I will try to modify the interface so that it looks more beautiful. 

Thanks!
